# Mail Reach
Submission For HackThe6ix

***
## About:
If you have a ton of people to email, and the same content to email them about, why not use Mail Reach?

You just need a .csv (excel) file with the columns: company names, person's name, their description, their company, their email and lastly, our ask.

This .csv gets uploaded to our program, our back-end using OpenAI GPT 4 drafts emails in no time. All the emails you have = the rows you had in your .csv file. You can toggle through all the drafts that are generated. Add in your own little spice in it. And, batch send all using one click!

Easy peasy lemon squeezy for whatever your endeavours maybe: getting internship, funding or job.

## Technologies:
